Course 1 teaches a little about the Python language related to data science. We'll share some existing libraries to help analyze your datasets. By the end of the course, you'll apply a classification model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease from a patient's health data. Course 2 covers the complete machine learning pipeline, from reading in, cleaning, and transforming data to running basic and advanced machine learning algorithms. In the final project, we'll apply our skills to compare different machine learning models in Python. In Course 3, we will build on our knowledge of basic models and explore more advanced AI techniques. We’ll describe the differences between the two techniques and explore how they differ. Then, we’ll complete a project predicting similarities between health patients using random forests. In Course 4, a capstone project course, we'll compare genome sequences of COVID-19 mutations to identify potential areas a drug therapy can look to target. By the end, you'll be well on your way to discovering ways to combat disease with genome sequencing.",Student must get the certification of AI for Scientific Research Specialization from Coursera to be accepted to the final examination,,10.0,359/QĐ-ĐHFPT dated 04/09/2025,True,"1.

Then dive into one subfield in data mining: pattern discovery. Learn in-depth concepts, methods, and applications of pattern discovery in data mining.  This courser will introduce methods for pattern-based classification and some interesting applications of pattern discovery. It also provides you the opportunity to learn skills and content to practice and engage in scalable pattern discovery methods on massive transactional data, discuss pattern evaluation measures, and study methods for mining diverse kinds of patterns, sequential patterns, and sub-graph patterns.","- Students must attend at least 80% of contact slots in order to be accepted to the final examination.- Student is responsible to do all exercises, assignments and labs given by instructor in class or at home and submit on time- Use laptop in class only for learning purpose- Promptly access to the FU FLM at https://flm.fpt.edu.vn/ for up-to-date course information","Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE",10.0,358/QĐ-ĐHFPT dated 04/03/2024,True,"Assignment: plus 0.5 to 1 points for completed Coursera certification, Final Result  <=10",5.0,True,4/3/2024,"### material(s)

The design of this course challenges students to apply their analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills to solve complex problems using AI technologies.Throughout this course, students will engage with all facets of the AI project development lifecycle, including problem identification, data collection and preprocessing, model design and implementation, evaluation, and deployment. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the professional standards and expectations required to successfully execute a project of this nature.This course is structured to be completed by small groups of 3-4 students, fostering collaboration and teamwork. Each group will be assigned a supervisor, who will offer critical support and guidance throughout the research and development process. The supervisor will assist students in refining their project ideas, conducting thorough research, developing and implementing AI solutions, composing a report on their capstone project, and preparing for the final presentation in front of the examination board.By the end of the course, students will have not only deepened their understanding of AI principles and techniques but also demonstrated their ability to apply these concepts effectively in a team-based project. This capstone project not only serves as a significant portfolio piece but also prepares students for professional careers in the field of artificial intelligence.","(1) Select a project within the chosen AI concentration: Teams should choose a project that aligns with their interests and the scope of the AI concentration. This may involve identifying a real-world problem that can be addressed with AI solutions.(2) Divide and schedule work: Once the project is chosen, teams should allocate tasks among members based on each individual's strengths and skills. A detailed schedule should be created, outlining milestones and deadlines to ensure timely progress.(3) Attend all scheduled meetings with supervisor: Teams must commit to regular meetings with their assigned supervisor. These sessions are crucial for receiving guidance, discussing progress, resolving any issues, and making necessary adjustments to the project plan.(4) Produce document and product according to project requirements: Teams are expected to produce comprehensive documentation and develop the AI product according to the specified requirements. This includes but is not limited to, designing algorithms, coding, testing, and validating the AI model(s). Documentation should detail the problem, methodology, implementation, results, and conclusions.(5) Present and defend individual contributions in front of the examination board: Each team member must be prepared to present and individually defend their specific contributions to the project in front of the examination board. This includes explaining the rationale behind their approach, the challenges faced, and the solutions implemented.",Appropriate tools for design and implementation,10.0,1286/QĐ-ĐHFPT dated 11/22/2024,True,,5.0,True,11/22/2024,"### material(s)
